Social Networks and Social Media have been the backbone for the growth and reach of the internet to millions and billions worldwide throughout the years. From the inception of Internet Relay Chat (IRC) which facilitated instant text messaging to the development of Web2 Social media which provided deeper and more meaningful connections through the internet with individuals worldwide with multimedia chat, live audio/video chat, groups and news feed for instant connection. However, this rapid growth in the internet and social media posed several risks and issues for the people using the platforms, ranging from data mining, privacy issues, and individual data traded and targeted by advertisement companies and other internet companies, it also led to addictive behaviour and several mental and physical health issues such as dopamine depletion causing long term depression, eye damage from long screen times and psychological damage from the constant flow of information through social media. With the rise of Web3, we can hope to leave the negative side effects of social media and aim to build a better version to negate the negative impact as much as possible by focusing on the fundamentals of social media and social connection through the internet instead of treating users as a data mining block for advertisers and internet companies. h3xWorld aims to do exactly that, it is a modern Web3 minimalistic social media with elements of mixed reality with an algorithm designed for connections instead of views and to reduce the negative impact of social media. The algorithm focuses on user interests, likes and social connection instead of feeding content designed to maximize user screen time. It comprises of a simple portfolio page where individuals can display and share their life, work, art, ideas and business products. Every user also has a blog section for further detailed posts, enhancing their writing skills and a store page if they choose to run a business online. Individuals can support each other and projects, creators and businesses they like through cryptocurrency and crypto crowdfunding. h3xWorld also incorporates AR/VR 3D spaces for users toÂ show off their creativity by building a space to their liking and invite people worldwide to the space for an immersive 3D socialization.
